    - hard to calculate as gas heating affects results

# mains

```


our circuit breakers:
- 16A@230V = 3680W
- For continuous load I wouldn't trust the french schuko with more than 13-14A (3000-3200W)
- If you want a socket that can do 16A all day all night you'd need a 16A CEE
- Most sockets are wired with 2.5mm2 solid copper wire
- Most power strips sold for home use have 1.5mm2 stranded wiring (NOT good for a 16A constant load, even though it says 16A on the package)

so:
- limit yourself to 3000w per socket
- 




```

Alright, so. There are various things that will limit the amount of current you can pull through a wall socket. An important factor is the socket itself. These are rated for 16A at 230v, so about 3680W (no idea where people are getting 4000+ watts, they want to kill you). BUT this type of residential plug is not rated for 16A 24/7, only for a short amount of time. Even on new sockets, when you pull 16A through them for hours and hours, they will get warmer and warmer, and might eventually melt. When they wear out and they get looser, dirtier and/or more oxidised, it'll be worse. I've seen this happen with electric/hybrid car chargers, which can pull 16A all day. For continuous load I wouldn't trust the french schuko with more than 13-14A (3000-3200W).  If you want a socket that can do 16A all day all night you'd need a 16A CEE (the blue ones you see at campings etc).

Then there's the wiring, normally sockets are wired with 2.5mm2 solid copper wire, which should be protected by either a 20A automatic breaker or in old installations a 16A melting fuse (lower rating because they're slower and less accurate/predictable than automatics). If the circuit is mixed in with some lights the breaker will be 16A (or 10A when it's an old melty one). So this means that when you have an automatic breaker, you'd technically be able to pull 20A through that single socket (as sockets here do not have individual breakers on them), which I wouldn't recommend. Pulling 10A each from two sockets is better.

Then there's your extension cords and distributors. Most of these sold for home use have 1.5mm2 stranded wiring, which is NOT good for a 16A constant load, even though it says 16A on the package. Only for a short while will it take 16A, a few hours and it will heat up and longer and bad things will happen. I've seen it happen with car chargers. The better ones have 2.5mm2 conductors and can take more, you'll generally find those at building supply stores (look for 2.5mm2 or 3G2.5). The basic home-use ones I wouldn't give more than 2400w continuously.

So to summarise: Try to limit yourself to 3000w per socket. Don't daisy-chain distributors. Check your plugs to make sure they're not getting warm.

Also, all the stuff you mentioned probably won't get you anywhere near 3000, if the lights are LED (because 'some lights' can be anything between a 6w desk light and a few 2000w halogen floodlights), so you should be fine.
