# voltage
- electric potential
- units: V (volt)
- formula:
  - V = AR       # (voltage = current * resistance)
  - V = J/C      # (voltage = energy / charge)
  - V = W/A      # (voltage = power / current)


# current
- rate of flow of electric charge
- units: A (amp, ampere)
- formula:
  - A = C/s      # (current = charge / time)
  - I = V/R      # (current = voltage / resistance)


# resistance
- opposition to flow of electric current
- units: Î© (ohm)
- formula:
  - R = V/I      # (resistance = voltage / current)
                 # aka. ratio of voltage across to current through


# power
- the *rate* at which energy is produced or consumed (energy/work over time).
- units: 
  - W (watt)
  - kW (kilo-watts)
- formula:
  - W = J/s      # (power = energy / time)
  - P = IV       # (power = current * voltage)

- total power by number of phases:
  - 1x25A x 230V =  5.75kW
  - 1x40A x 230V =  9.20kW
  - 3x25A x 230V = 17.25kW
  - 3x35A x 230V = 24.15kW


# energy
- unit of *work*
- units:
  - J (joule)
  - Wh (watt-hour)
- formula:
  - J = CV       # (energy = charge * voltage)
  -              # (energy = power * time)


# charge
- current flow * time
- used to represent battery pack capcity
- units: 
  - Ah, mAh (amp-hours, milliamp-hours)
  - C (coulombs)
- formula: 
  - C = As       # (charge = current * time)
  - Q = It       # (charge = current * time)
  - Q = W/V      # (charge = energy / voltage)

circuit breakers:
- 16A@230V = 3680W
- For continuous load don't trust the french schuko with more than 13-14A (3000-3200W)
- If you want a socket that can do 16A all day all night you'd need a 16A CEE
- Most sockets are wired with 2.5mm2 solid copper wire
- Most power strips sold for home use have 1.5mm2 stranded wiring (NOT good for a 16A constant load, even though it says 16A on the package)

so:
- limit loads to 3000W (13A) per wall socket
