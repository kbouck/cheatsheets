"CORS is an implementation in the browser and is designed to protect the user from malicious applications by ensuring that the resource in the browser is only allowed to access specific endpoints.

This browser implementation can be bypassed at any time. First, it is up to the browser itself: if CORS is not integrated, or not integrated cleanly, then it will not work. The server sends a CORS header and it is up to the browser to decide how to handle it. This is not a security element, because it is not in the hands of the server to deny access here, but solely in the hands of the browser."
